## Features
* Temperature Monitoring: Records and displays temperature recent value with their timestamps.
* Vibration Monitoring: Records and displays vibration recent value with their timestamps.
* IoT Dashboard: Visualizes temperature and vibration data with timestamps.
* API Integration: A RESTful API for inserting and retrieving data.
* SQLite Database: Stores the recorded temperature and vibration data variations.
